# Linux System Monitor (Shell Script)

## 📋 Project Overview

This project is a simple yet powerful **Linux system monitor** created using a **shell script**. It continuously tracks key system resources — **CPU**, **memory**, and **disk usage** — and displays their usage percentages in real time.

If any resource exceeds a user-defined threshold, the script immediately raises an **alert**, helping you identify and respond to potential performance issues.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 Real-time monitoring of:
  - CPU usage
  - Memory usage
  - Disk usage
- 🚨 Alert system for threshold breaches
- 🔁 Continuous monitoring loop
- 🧠 Learn by doing: gain hands-on experience with Linux shell scripting

## 🛠️ How It Works

The shell script uses standard Linux tools such as `top`, `free`, and `df` to collect system resource data. The values are parsed and compared to predefined thresholds. When usage exceeds any threshold, an alert is printed to the terminal.

## 📦 Requirements

- A Unix-like operating system (Linux recommended)
- Bash shell
- Basic command-line tools (`top`, `free`, `df`, `awk`, `grep`)
